# Master's thesis data-Policy-Circumvention-and-Leakage-in-Inter-regional-Population-Mobilization
This project contains databases and code files for master thesis of Public Policy./n
The thesis is "Policy Circumvention and Leakage in Inter-regional Population Mobilization: an Agent-Based Model Simulation". Based on the cross-regional mobility restriction policy for routine epidemic prevention and control in Beijing in 2022, this study constructs an Agent-Based Model (ABM) for multi-agent decision-making, designs deductive experiments to simulate cross-regional mobility in the context of infectious disease transmission, analyzes the Pareto efficiency of the policy and the occurrence of circumvention and leakage phenomena, in order to discover policy strategies that are conducive to controlling the risk of virus transmission and maintaining population mobility./n
All ABM code and simulation data are uploaded, with R code of data collaction, analysis and visualiazation./n
Please contact me if there is any problem or to provide suggestions./n
